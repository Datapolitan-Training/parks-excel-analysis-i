# 5 Data Analytics Tasks
--

1. Aggregating (PivotTable)
--

2. Sorting
--

3. Filtering
--

4. Manipulating
--

5. Visualizing

---

# 1. Aggregating Data 
--

+ Trends only become clear in aggregate
--

+ Often where you discover the "so what"
--

+ Aggregating data meaningfully can be tricky

---

# 2. Sorting
--

+ Reorganize rows in a dataset based on the values in a column
--

+ Can sort on multiple columns

---

# Sorting by Date
--

![img-center-100](images/sort_overview.png)
--


![img-center-100](images/sort1.png)

---

# Sorting by Date

---

# Sorting by Date
![img-center-60](images/sort4.png)
--


![img-center-60](images/sort_final.png)

---

# 3. Filtering
--

+ Only show rows that contain some value
--

+ Can filter by multiple values
--

+ Can filter by values in multiple columns

---

# Filtering
![img-center-100](images/filtering1.png)

---

# Filtering

---

# Conditional Formatting

---

# Your Turn
--

+ Working in groups, explore the 311 data set
--

+ Identify something of interest in the dataset using the skills we've demonstrated
--

+ Focus on practicing the skills rather than arriving at an interesting result
--

+ We're here to help if you have any questions

# Exploratory Data Analysis
--

+ Goal -> Discover patterns in the data
--

+ Understand the context
--

+ Summarize fields
--

+ Use graphical representations of the data
--

+ Explore outliers
--


####Tukey, J.W. (1977). Exploratory data analysis. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley

---

# 4. Manipulating Data (In a good way...)
--

+ Sometimes available categories don't make sense
--

+ Values may not be in the format you need (or have mistakes)
--

+ You always want to have a clean copy of the data to go back to
--

+ Best to keep track of what you've done

---

# Functions in Excel
--

+ Allow you to do calculations in Excel
--

+ Also allow you to manipulate text
--

+ And a whole lot more...

---

name:cat-function
# Some Categories of Functions in Excel
--

+ Database functions
--

+ Date and time functions
--

+ Financial functions
--

+ Logical functions
--

+ Lookup and reference functions
--

+ Math and trigonometry functions
--

+ Statistical functions
--

+ Text functions
--

+ 13 categories in total
