--

1. Aggregating (PivotTable)
--

2. Sorting
--

3. Filtering
--

4. Manipulating
--

5. Visualizing

---

# 1. Aggregating Data 
???
+ Facilitator reminds participants we've already done this work with the available data
+ Facilitator prompts participants to think of other ways they aggregate data for insights
--

+ Trends only become clear in aggregate
--

+ Often where you discover the "so what"
--

+ Aggregating data meaningfully can be tricky
--


![img-center-70](images/311data_parks.png)

---

# 2. Sorting
???
+ Facilitator discusses briefly the value of sorting, soliciting examples from participants of when they've sorted data for their work

---

# Conditional Formatting
![img-center-65](images/cf1.png)
???
+ Optionally, the facilitator can introduce conditional formatting to more visually display the information being analyzed
+ Be mindful of the participants and how easily (or not) they take in this additional information, which is a digression from the main-line of information presented
+ Solicit examples from participants on when they have used conditional formatting

---

# Conditional Formatting
![img-center-80](images/cf2.png)

---

# Remember this?
![img-center-50](images/ideation_post_its.png)
???
+ Having concluded the demonstration of initial skills, facilitator conducts a short ideation exercise of no more than 5 mins to brainstorm questions for the exercises to follow
+ The goal of this is to connect and reinforce [the learning from Introduction to Data Analytics](http://training.datapolitan.com/parks-intro-analytics/#brainstorm)

---

# Your Turn
???
+ Facilitator moves participants into groups and runs brief ideation session with them to get questions they will explore
+ This is a release exercise for them to practice skills and meant to go until lunch with an optional check-in if time
--

+ Working in groups, brainstorm some key questions you'd like to explore in this dataset
--

+ We'll be using this project you're creating as we go through the class
--

+ And you can change your minds
--

+ Focus on practicing the skills rather than arriving at an interesting result
--

+ **Document your steps in whatever way makes sense**

+ This is a teachable moment to talk about documenting work
--

+ Take a minute and look over what you wrote down
--

+ Could you redo your work based on what you did? Why or why not?
--

+ Imagine this was an important project, what would you do different?

---

# Why Document?
???
+ Facilitator emphasizes need for work to be auditible and reproducible
--

+ Keep record of steps
--

+ Allows us to verify work

# Extracting Hour From Timestamp

![img-center-100](images/hour2.png)

---

# Extracting Hour From Timestamp

![img-center-100](images/hour3.png)
???
+ Facilitator discusses data types and how to convert from one to the other (in this case date to number)
+ It's key to remember we're converting the time to a number that represents the hour of the day, not to just the hour. There is a subtle difference that keeps coming up when participants just want to reformat the date-time to display hour

+ Refresh the PivotTable
???
+ Important skill to reinforce with participants -> always refresh pivottable if you've made any changes to your data, even if you create a new pivottable, it won't take your updates until you refresh
--

+ Add `dow` to Rows
--

+ Format the chart


![img-center-75](images/dow_parks.gif)

???
+ Facilitator pauses to check knowledge and make sure students understand material
+ Graph data to make sure they get the reason for what we're doing before showing the `choose`
+ If time, discuss the need to have the same number of each day represented in the data in order to avoid bias
---

# Charting Noise Complaints by Week Day
+ You could also use `CHOOSE`
???
+ See not above about skipping this if participants are having difficulty with the previous exercise
--

# 5. Visualizing Data
???
+ Facilitator introduces the basic concepts of why we visualize data before leading participants through an exercise to create the chart shown
--

+ Quickly communicate information
--

+ Tell a clearer story
--

+ A picture is worth a thousands words

---

+ Style the chart

![img-center-70](images/311data_parks.png)

---

# Exporting Graphics
???
+ Facilitator demonstrates steps to export graphics from Excel to other applications
+ Solicit feedback from participants on why this is important and any challenges they've had in doing so
--

+ You can copy and paste graphics into any Microsoft application
--

+ The default is a Microsoft Office Graphic Object
???
+ I prefer to paste as picture to preserve the formatting, but there are reasons to paste as a graphic object that can be edited
+ Ideally facilitator will discuss the pros and cons with participants
--

![img-right-50](images/copy1.png)
--

+ You can change to an image or other format
--

+ [More information is online](http://www.thespreadsheetguru.com/blog/best-way-to-paste-special-excel-objects-as-powerpoint-images)

---

# Your Turn
???
+ Facilitator initiates a release exercise for participants to continue working on their mini-projects
+ The idea is to connect the previous learning in Introduction to Data Analytics to come up with a workable process map sequencing their questions into a logical order
--

+ Working in your groups, develop a process map for your project
--

+ Focus on the inputs and outputs, but think about the potential impact
--

+ Create a story with graphs and other explanatory aids
--

+ Don't forget to add documentation
--

+ You'll have more time to work on this and be ready to present
--

+ Feel free to reach out if you have any questions


---

<!-- start of D block -->
# Visualizing Data
???
+ Facilitator leads a discussion of the key elements in visualization
+ The goal is to get participants to recognize their own innate sense of what makes for a "good" visualization and to trust that sense
+ Throughout this discussion, I ask why they like or dislike a particular visualization compared to another, forcing them to articulate their reasons

---

# Why do we visualize data?

![img-center-70](images/vision_zero.png)
.caption[Source: Ontodia Civic Dashboards Project]
???
+ Facilitator introduces the participants to the Vision Zero initiative and asks where traffic fatalities happen
+ Note: [Source link no longer works](http://blog.civicdashboards.com/2014/01/vision-zero-visualizing-traffic-related-fatalities/)
---

# Why do we visualize data?

![img-center-100](images/vision_zero_table.png)
???
+ Facilitator asks if this is a better or worse way to display the data and why
---

# Bar Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart1_parks.png)
???
+ Facilitator prompts with question "What are we visualizing here?"
---

#"Barless" Bar Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart2_parks.png)
???
+ Facilitator prompts with question "What are we visualizing here?"
+ Important to let them realize this is the same data and then ask if it is better or worse than previous, and why
+ Good to point out the lack of line between the point and the label, hard to compare across categories
---

# Horizontal Bar Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart3_parks.png)
???
+ Key feature of this chart is labels that are easier to read across and longer range so smaller quantities can be compared
+ Odd for data to be displayed this way vs. vertical bars
---

# Ranked Horizontal Bar Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart4_parks.png)
???
+ Sorting the data allows for data points to be rank-ordered and easier to understand
---

# Grouped Bar Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart5_parks.png)
???
+ Allows categories to be compared together
+ Increases the information density (also saves space)
---

# Grouped Bar Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart6_parks.png)
???
+ Demonstrates the impact of losing color, and how powerful color is as a discriminator in visualizations
---

# Precognitive Processing
![img-center-100](images/chart7.png)
???
+ Facilitator prompts participants to find the red circle on the right and then on the left to demonstrate the ease of determining difference in color vs shape
+ Connect to idea of [precognitive (or "preattentive") visual processing](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/preattentive-visual-properties-and-how-to-use-them-in-information-visualization) to make visualiations easier to understand
---

# Stacked Bar Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart7_parks.png)
???
+ Facilitator introduces stacked bar chart, discussing pros (able to compare) with cons (hard to interpret without labels)

# 100% Stacked Bar Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart7a_parks.png)
???
+ Facilitator introduces stacked bar chart, discussing pros (able to compare) with cons (hard to interpret without labels)
+ Solicit feedback from students on what they think of the chart type
---

# Stacked Bar Chart
+ Which of these do you like better?


![img-left-50](images/311_chart7_parks.png)
![img-right-50](images/311_chart7a_parks.png)

???
+ Facilitator runs brief discussion of which group likes and why
--

##### &nbsp;
+ Why?
???
+ Most participants don't like either, but they should be able to describe why in clear terms
---

# Line Chart
![img-center-95](images/311_chart8_parks.png)
???
+ Facilitator discusses when to use a line chart (time-series data connected to each other)
+ Possible to point out the visualization encodes not only the level but the relationship of one to the next (slope of the line)
+ Can point out this is like the heart-beat of the city, or at least of NYC Parks

---

# Why use a line chart?
![img-center-100](images/311_chart8a_parks.png)
???
+ Facilitator asks participants to pick a visualization of the data and why, iwth the opportunity to change if they are compelled one way or the other.
+ Column chart is more accurate in that each day is a discreet unit. Area chart gives "feeling" of call volume better than simple line chart. No one should like the dot chart.
---

# Line Chart with Categorical Data
![img-center-95](images/311_chart9_parks.png)
???
+ This is an example of what not to do with the data. Each category is distinct and not related, though the chart implies it is. Participants will likely have done this before, but should be asked to reflect on whether one category has an impact on another.
+ Good opportunity to reflect on the fact Excel doesn't care about the kind of chart you create and will produce whatever you tell it to
---

# Multi-Line Chart
![img-center-90](images/311_chart10_parks.png)
???
+ Facilitator introduces multi-line charts and their value (comparison, increased information density)
---

# Multi-Line Chart
![img-center-100](images/311_chart11_parks.png)
???
+ Facilitator describes situation with too much information
+ Good point to emphasize "Not everything that is true is interesting" and give them permission to not display all the data if it doesn't contribute to a true and compelling story (so long as they're not ignoring the data)
---

# Pie Charts
![img-center-85](images/311_chart13_parks.png)
???
+ Facilitator asks "When do you use a pie chart?" or "What are pie charts good for?" (absolutely nothing...)
+ Pie charts are best used to show proportions (and not time-series data or more than one variable)

---

# Pie Charts
![img-center-100](images/chart15_trim.png)
???
+ Facilitator prompts participants to identify the largest slices in each pie chart

???
+ Facilitator presents an alternative scenario of many small slices as a potential issue
+ Good to note tendency to add labels to the point of making it a table with color and point out the color reuse in the chart, making it hard to interpret

???
+ Facilitator carefully points out this is a common issue and leads them through an exploration of this chart, asking:
1. "Which candidate got the most support?"
2. "Which slice looks bigger?"
+ Participants pick up on the issue of being more than 100%. Review links for more information on the context (respondents could pick more than one figure to support)

---

# Donut Chart
![img-center-80](images/311_chart18_parks.png)
???
+ The donut chart is preferred in any instance where one would normally use a pie chart
+ The loss of visual accuity occurs in the center of the pie (so we pull it out)
---
name:treemap
# [Treemap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping)
![img-center-100](images/treemap_parks.png)
???
+ An alternative visualization that is more advanced, but interesting for it's possibilities (still probably need numbers)

# Final Thoughts
???
+ Facilitator wraps up class with key points to remember
--

+ Data can tell a story, but doesn't speak for itself
--

+ Analysis is the search for understanding and where we learn to tell that story
--

+ Be good to your data and it will be good to you
--

+ If you don't document it, it's like it never happened


---
exclude: true
+ Don't try to boil the ocean
+ Data can tell a story, but doesn't speak for itself
+ Good analysis is about telling a true and compelling story
+ Be good to your data and it will be good to you
+ Try to focus on outcomes, not just outputs
